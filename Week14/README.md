In today’s lecture, we tested MQTT using two laptops. 
My laptop worked as the subscriber so the IP is 172.20.10.13 and my group mate’s laptop worked as the publisher. We both used the same IP, same topic name (yet unique) and unique client names as I used subscriber-Adeen and she used publisher-Meerab. Both laptops are connected to the same Wi-Fi network so the sub-pub can communicate properly. We she published the value of the Temperature. I received it both on the terminal as well as on the MQTT Explorer. Then we repeated the process in reverse means she worked as the subscriber and I as the publisher.
